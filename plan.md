FPS should have an option to be capped.



# Observer pattern and abstraction

event systems are extremely important. In a quest to make them intuitive, I could take inspiration off the idea of a notification system. if anyone cares about x happening they can run their own code.

*creating a notification*
`Observer.notify<event>`

*listen for notification*
`Observer.listen<event>`

alternatively similar to the p5 library listener events are their own function
*this code does not need to be syntactically correct, it just need to work*
`Observer<event>{ code }`


# Bismuth

## What is Bismuth?
Bismuth is a game engine + editor that I am working on which I plan to ship a commercial game on top of. **[extension required]**

## What are the goals of this game engine?
I want to be able to ship a few games on top of the engine. With each game increasing in complexity before finally shipping my commercial game. While the game engine editor will initially be extremely barebones, there will be rework on the engine editor to make development easy for inexperienced developers.

## What will the game engine not have?

**Note: this list will most likely change overtime depending on features I want for the games**

It is often difficult to know what you need for your game engine because there's alot of features you know you will need and you may forget some. Rather it is better to be aware of the features you know you won't have / won't need.

Here are some of the following:
- Mobile support (mobile development is beyond the scope and I'm not interested in it)
- Networking code
- Integration of git
- Webgl support (web development is beyond the scope of the project)

**[more to add maybe]**

## Suika3D

Suika is a popular game in the nintendo. The objective involves dropping various fruits into a jar and ensuring not to out of the box. Combining fruits will make a larger fruit, in which you'll eventually end up with a Watermelon (NB: combining two watermelons will make the smallest fruit, essentially making the circle complete).

Using my game engine I want to create the following game but in 3D.

This will involve the following components
